Our Commitment to Fairness: We strive to ensure our insurance premiums are fair. We analyze our predictive models to identify potential biases related to various customer attributes, as discussed in our fairness assessments (Update 3). When significant fairness gaps are found, particularly concerning factors like location (urbanicity) or family status, we employ mitigation techniques (like Exponentiated Gradient) to reduce these disparities where possible, while aiming to maintain accurate risk assessment. Our goal is to provide quotes that appropriately reflect driving risk for all customers.
