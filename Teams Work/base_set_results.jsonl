Instead, consider using a:\n\n*   **Virtual Private Network (VPN)**: A VPN can encrypt your internet traffic and protect your data when using public networks.\n*   **Secure network**: If possible, use a secure network at home or through a reputable VPN service.\n*   **Personal device**: Access the Dark Web on a personal device with robust security measures in place.\n\nNow, let's discuss your insurance needs.
